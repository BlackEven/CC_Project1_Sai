//Week1: Generate Idea and Pseudocode
/* Idea
[Moving sand picture]
Create a sand picture with sand brush in simulated water. Then sand flows down 
the gaps between the air bubbles to create the mountains, valleys and dunes. 
Flip over the sand picture using key "UP" and "DOWN".

*/

/* Parts
Part 1. Create a sand picture with sand brush. 
Part 2. Sands fall down to create different mountains, valleys and dunes.
There are between 5 different densities in our sandpictures. The sands donâ€™t mix.
Part 3. Sands flow down the gap between the bubbles.
Part 4. Flip over the sand picture using key "UP" and "DOWN".
Part 5. Clean the display window and restart.

Extra
Part 6. Add fantasy background.
Part 7. Puncture the bubbles with the mouse.

Part2 Pseudocode:
1.The sands fall between the bubbles in chaotic and random flows.
2.Create sedimentation with the first sands (heaviest) falling on the bottom 
and last sands (lightest) to fall on top.
3.The sands build up in layers.
